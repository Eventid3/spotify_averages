    <h1>INFO</h1>
    <p>Spotify Averages shows you some of the audio analysis done by Spotify.</p>
    <p>Spotify has serveral algorithms that analyse the audio of all tracks, and presents the resulst via different parameters.
        We at Spotify Averages show these results to you, in a convenient way, and also allows you to check out the evolution of all this info, over time
    </p>
    <p>Below is a list of all the parameters that make up this analysis, and Spotify's description of each parameter.</p>
    
    <h3>LOUDNESS</h3>
    <p>The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.</p>
    <h3>DANCEABILITY</h3>
    <p>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0% is least danceable and 100% is most danceable.</p>
    <h3>VALENCE</h3>
    <p>A measure from 0% to 100% describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</p>
    <h3>SPEECHINESS</h3>
    <p>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 100% the attribute value. Values above 66% describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 33% and 66% describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 33% most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</p>
    <h3>ACOUSTICNESS</h3>
    <p>A confidence measure from 0% to 100% of whether the track is acoustic. 100% represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</p>
    <h3>DURATION</h3>
    <p>The duration of the track in minutes and seconds.</p>
